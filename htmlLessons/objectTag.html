    <!--
        The <object> tag in HTML is used to embed various types of media objects, such as images, audio, video, or other types of content, into an HTML document. The content that is embedded using the <object> tag can be either a standalone file or an inline content that is part of the HTML page.

        Here is an example of how to use the <object> tag to embed an image:
    -->

    <object data="image.jpg" type="image/jpg">
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
    </object>

    <!--
        In this example, the data attribute specifies the URL of the image file, while the type attribute indicates the MIME type of the embedded content. The <img> tag nested inside the <object> tag is used as a fallback in case the embedded content cannot be displayed.

        The <object> tag can also be used to embed other types of content, such as video or audio files, by specifying the appropriate MIME type and URL of the file in the data attribute. Additionally, the <param> tag can be used to specify additional parameters for the embedded content, such as the width and height of the object or the autoplay setting for a video or audio file.
