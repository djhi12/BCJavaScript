        The HTML "audio" element is used to embed audio content, such as music or podcasts, into a webpage. Here's an example of how to use the "audio" element:
    -->

    <audio controls>
        <source src="music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>

    <!--
        In the above example, the "audio" element includes a "source" element with the "src" attribute set to the URL of the audio file, and the "type" attribute set to the MIME type of the audio file. The "controls" attribute enables the browser's default audio controls, such as play, pause, and volume.

        If the browser does not support the "audio" element or the specified MIME type, it will display the fallback content specified between the "audio" tags, which in this case is the text "Your browser does not support the audio element."
    -->
