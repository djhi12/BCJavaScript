<!--
    The <article> tag is an HTML5 element that represents an independent piece of content that can be considered separate from the rest of the page's content. It is typically used for blog posts, news articles, forum posts, or other similar types of content.

    The content within an <article> tag should be self-contained and meaningful on its own, without relying on other content on the page. It should also have a heading to provide context to the reader.
