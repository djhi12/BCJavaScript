    <!--
        The HTML <article> tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed or reused independently. It is typically used to define blog posts, news articles, or other types of content that can stand alone and may be syndicated across different websites or platforms.

        The <article> tag should be used to enclose the main content of the article, including any headings, paragraphs, images, and other relevant elements. It should not include any content that is not directly related to the article, such as navigation links or advertising.
    -->

    <!-- Here's an example of how to use the <article> tag in HTML: -->
    <article>
        <h1>My Awesome Article</h1>
        <p>This is the main content of my article.</p>
        <img src="article-image.jpg" alt="An image related to my article">
        <p>Here's another paragraph in my article.</p>
    </article>


    <!--
        By using the <article> tag to wrap around the main content of your article, you can provide semantic meaning to your content and make it easier for search engines and other applications to understand and index your content.
