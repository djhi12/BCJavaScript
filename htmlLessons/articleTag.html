<!--
    In HTML, the <article> element is used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused. It represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, such as a blog post, news article, or product review.

    The content inside the <article> tag should be related to a single topic or theme, and it should make sense when read on its own. It can contain various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and other structural markup.
