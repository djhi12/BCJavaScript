        HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML5 was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and was released in 2014.

        Some of the new features introduced in HTML5 include:

            Semantic elements: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements, such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>, which help describe the content of a webpage in a more meaningful way.

            Improved multimedia support: HTML5 includes built-in support for audio and video playback, without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

            Responsive design: HTML5 provides better support for creating responsive websites that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

            Canvas and SVG: HTML5 introduces the <canvas> element, which allows for dynamic graphics and animations to be created using JavaScript. It also includes the <svg> element for creating vector graphics.

            Offline caching: HTML5 includes new features for offline caching, which allow web applications to continue functioning even when there is no internet connection.

        Overall, HTML5 provides a more powerful and flexible set of tools for web developers to create modern, dynamic, and interactive websites and web applications.
