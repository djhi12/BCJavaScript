        In HTML, the "video" element is used to embed video content into a web page. The video element requires a few attributes to work properly, including the "src" attribute to specify the URL of the video file, and the "controls" attribute to add playback controls like play, pause, and volume.

        Here's an example of how to use the "video" element:
    -->

    <video src="example.mp4" controls>
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <!--
        In this example, the "src" attribute is set to "example.mp4", which is the URL of the video file. The "controls" attribute is also included to enable playback controls for the video.

        If the browser does not support the "video" element, the text "Your browser does not support the video tag." will be displayed as a fallback.
    -->
