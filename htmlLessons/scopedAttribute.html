        The "scoped" attribute in HTML was introduced in the HTML5 specification but has been deprecated and removed in the latest HTML specification. It was used to limit the scope of styles defined within a <style> element to a specific section of the document.

        Here's how the "scoped" attribute worked:

        <style> element: Inside the <style> element, you could define CSS rules to style elements within a specific section of the document.

        Scoped attribute: By adding the "scoped" attribute to the <style> element, you indicated that the styles defined within that element should only apply to the section of the document where the <style> element was located.

        Section of the document: The section of the document where the styles would apply was determined by the closest ancestor <section>, <article>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <body>, <details>, <fieldset>, <figure>, <header>, <main>, <menu>, <nav>, or <section> element.

        The idea behind the "scoped" attribute was to encapsulate styles within a specific section, preventing them from affecting the rest of the document. However, due to various issues and limitations, including the lack of browser support and potential confusion with the cascading nature of CSS, the attribute was deprecated and ultimately removed from the HTML specification.

        As an alternative, you can achieve similar functionality using CSS methodologies such as BEM (Block Element Modifier) or CSS modules, which provide better control and encapsulation of styles within specific components or sections of a document.
