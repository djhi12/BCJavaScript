    <!--
        The "br" tag in HTML stands for "line break" and is used to insert a single line break in the content of a web page. It is a self-closing tag, which means that it does not require a closing tag.
    -->

    <!-- The syntax for using the "br" tag is as follows: -->
    <br>


    <!--
        You can also use the optional attribute "clear" with the "br" tag to specify how the line break should behave in relation to surrounding elements. The "clear" attribute can have one of three values: "left", "right", or "all".

        Here's an example of using the "br" tag:
    -->
    <p>This is the first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>

    <!-- Note that the "br" tag is not recommended for use in structuring the layout of a web page. Instead, you should use CSS to control the layout and positioning of elements on the page. -->
