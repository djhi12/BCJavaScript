        In HTML, the id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element within a web page. This attribute assigns a unique identifier to an HTML element, which can be used by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate or access the element.

        The id attribute must be unique within the entire document. It can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods, but it must begin with a letter or an underscore. The id attribute value is case-sensitive.

    <!-- Here's an example of how to use the id attribute in HTML: -->
