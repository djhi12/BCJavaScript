<!--
    In HTML, the "id" attribute is used to give an element a unique identifier that can be referenced by other parts of the HTML document or by scripts. The value of the "id" attribute should be unique within the document.

    The "id" attribute is commonly used in conjunction with CSS to apply styles to specific elements. For example, you can define a CSS rule that applies styles to an element with a specific "id" value by using the "#" symbol followed by the "id" value in your CSS selector.

    Note that the "id" attribute should only be used for unique identifiers within a single HTML document. If you need to reference an element across multiple pages, you should use a different method, such as a unique URL or a class attribute.
