    In HTML, there are several types of list tags that can be used to structure content on a webpage. These tags are used to group related items together and make the content more organized and easier to read.

    Here are the three main types of list tags in HTML:

    <ul> tag: This is an unordered list tag, which is used to create a bulleted list of items. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet point.

    <ol> tag: This is an ordered list tag, which is used to create a numbered list of items. Each item in the list is marked with a number.

    <dl> tag: This is a definition list tag, which is used to create a list of terms and their definitions. Each term in the list is marked with a <dt> tag, and each definition is marked with a <dd> tag.

    Note that all of these list tags use the <li> tag to mark each item in the list.
