        HTML comments are special lines of text that are ignored by web browsers, but can be viewed by developers or anyone who looks at the page's source code. HTML comments are used to add notes or explanations to HTML code, or to temporarily remove code from a page without deleting it.

        HTML comments are written with the and tags. Anything between these tags is considered a comment and is not displayed on the web page. For example:
    -->

    <!-- This is a comment. It will not be displayed on the web page. -->


    <!-- You can also use comments to temporarily remove code from a page without deleting it, like this: -->
    
    <!--
        <div>This is a div that will not be displayed because it is commented out.</div>
    -->
