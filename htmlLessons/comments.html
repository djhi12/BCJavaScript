    In HTML, comments are used to write notes or remarks that are not meant to be displayed in the web page's content. They are intended to provide information to other developers or to help you remember what a particular section of code does.

    Anything you put between the <!- - and - -> symbols will be considered a comment and will not be displayed on the page. You can also use comments to temporarily remove a section of code from the page without deleting it, which can be useful for debugging or testing purposes.
