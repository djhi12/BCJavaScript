<!--
    In HTML, an "HTML tag" is a piece of code that is used to define the structure and content of a web page. HTML tags are used to mark up the content of a web page, which tells the browser how to display the content to the user.

    HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and consist of two parts: the opening tag and the closing tag. The opening tag is used to start a particular element, and the closing tag is used to end that element. The content that goes between the opening and closing tags is the content that will be displayed on the web page.
