    <!--
        The max attribute is an HTML attribute used to specify the maximum value for an <input> element with a type of number, range, date, datetime-local, month, or time.

        The max attribute restricts the range of valid values that can be entered or selected by the user. For example, if you have an input element with a type of number and max attribute set to 10, the user can only input a value between 0 and 10 (inclusive). If the user tries to input a value greater than 10, an error message will be displayed.

        Here's an example of how to use the max attribute with an input element of type number:
    -->

    <label for="quantity">Quantity:</label>
    <input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10">

    <!--
        In this example, the max attribute is set to 10, which means that the user can only input a number between 1 and 10.
    -->
