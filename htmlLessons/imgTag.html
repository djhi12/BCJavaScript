    In HTML, the "img" tag is used to insert an image into a web page. 

    The "src" attribute specifies the URL or file path of the image file. The "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or if the user is using a screen reader. It is important to include descriptive alternative text for accessibility purposes.
