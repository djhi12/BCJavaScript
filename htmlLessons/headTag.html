        The <head> tag is a container for metadata and other information about an HTML document. It is placed between the <html> and <body> tags and is not displayed in the web browser.

        Some of the common elements that can be included within the <head> tag are:

            <title>: This element specifies the title of the document that appears in the browser tab and search engine results.

            <meta>: This element provides metadata about the document such as the character encoding, keywords, description, author, and viewport settings.

            <link>: This element is used to link to external resources such as stylesheets, icons, and web fonts.
            
            <style>: This element is used to define CSS styles that apply to the document.

            <script>: This element is used to include JavaScript code in the document.
