    Image copyright refers to the legal ownership and control of an image or photograph. It means that the creator or owner of the image has the exclusive right to use, reproduce, distribute, and display the image. The creator or owner may choose to license or sell the rights to use the image to others, but without permission, it is illegal for anyone else to use the image.

    To use an image that is copyrighted, you must obtain permission from the owner or creator of the image. This can be done by contacting the owner directly or through a licensing agency. Using a copyrighted image without permission is considered copyright infringement and can result in legal action, including fines and damages.

    It's important to note that not all images are copyrighted, as some may fall under the public domain or be released under a Creative Commons license that allows for free use under certain conditions. However, it's always best to assume that an image is copyrighted unless you have specific information stating otherwise.
