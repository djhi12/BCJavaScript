    <!--
        In HTML, the "value" attribute is used to set the initial value of an input element. The input element can be of various types such as text, number, radio, checkbox, etc.

        For example, if you have an input element of type "text" and you want to set its initial value as "Hello World", you can use the following code:
    -->

    <input type="text" value="Hello World">

    <!--
        Similarly, if you have a checkbox input element and you want to set its initial value as "checked", you can use the following code:
    -->

    <input type="checkbox" value="checked" checked>

    <!--
        Note that the "value" attribute is not applicable for all types of input elements. For example, the "value" attribute is not applicable for the "button" element.
    -->
