    <!--
        The min attribute is an attribute used in HTML input elements of type number, range, date, datetime, datetime-local, month, time, and week. It specifies the minimum value that can be entered into the input field.

        For example, if you have an input field for a person's age, you can use the min attribute to specify that the minimum age that can be entered is 18:
    -->
    <label for="age">Age:</label>
    <input type="number" id="age" name="age" min="18">

    <!--
        In this example, the min attribute is set to "18". This means that the input field will not allow any value less than 18 to be entered.

        If the user tries to enter a value less than 18, the input field will display an error message indicating that the entered value is too small.
    -->
