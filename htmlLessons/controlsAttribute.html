    <!--
        The controls attribute is an HTML attribute used in the audio and video elements to specify that the media player should display controls such as play, pause, volume, and seek bar. When the controls attribute is present, the user can interact with the media player directly on the web page, without having to use external controls or software.

        The controls attribute does not take any values, and its presence or absence determines whether or not controls are displayed. For example, to include controls in an audio element, you would use the following code:
    -->

    <audio src="my_audio_file.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>

    <!--
        Similarly, to include controls in a video element, you would use:
    -->

    <video src="my_video_file.mp4" controls>
        Your browser does not support the video element.
    </video>

    <!--
        The controls attribute is a convenient way to add basic media player functionality to a web page without having to write custom JavaScript code. However, if you need more advanced features, you may need to use a JavaScript library or build a custom player from scratch.
