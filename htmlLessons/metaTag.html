        In HTML, the "meta" tag is used to provide metadata about a web page. Metadata is information about the data on the page, such as the author, description, and keywords, that is not displayed directly on the page but is used by search engines and other software to understand the content of the page.

        The "name" attribute specifies the type of metadata being provided, and the "content" attribute provides the value for that metadata.

        Here are some common types of metadata that can be provided using the "meta" tag:

            "description": a brief summary of the page's content, often used by search engines as the text displayed in search results.
            "keywords": a comma-separated list of keywords that describe the page's content, also used by search engines to help determine the relevance of the page to a particular search query.
            "author": the name of the person or organization responsible for creating the page.
            "viewport": controls the width and scaling of the page on mobile devices.
            "charset": specifies the character encoding used in the page.
