    The "meta tag" is an HTML element that provides metadata about an HTML document. It is placed within the head section of an HTML document and does not have a closing tag.

    The meta tag includes various attributes that define the metadata information, such as the content type, keywords, description, author, and viewport. These attributes provide additional information about the HTML document, which is used by search engines, web crawlers, and other software to better understand and categorize the content of the page.
