        The HTML "progress" element is used to represent the progress of a task or a process that is underway. It can be used to display a progress bar, which indicates the percentage of completion of the task or process.

        The "progress" element requires a value and a max attribute to be set. The value attribute represents the current progress of the task, while the max attribute represents the total amount of work that needs to be done.
    -->

    <progress value="50" max="100"></progress>

    <!--
        In this example, the progress bar is 50% complete. The maximum value is 100, indicating that the task is halfway done.
