    <!--
        The "em" tag in HTML is used to indicate emphasis in text. When the "em" tag is used, the enclosed text is typically displayed in italics, but the exact style of the emphasized text can vary depending on the CSS applied to the document.
    -->

    <p>This sentence contains <em>emphasized text</em>.</p>

    <!--
        In this example, the words "emphasized text" will be displayed in italics. The "em" tag can be nested within other tags to indicate emphasis within specific portions of text.

        It's important to note that the "em" tag should be used for semantic emphasis, not just for styling. In other words, the text enclosed in the "em" tag should actually be emphasized in some way, rather than just being styled differently for visual purposes.
