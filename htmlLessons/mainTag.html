        The <main> tag in HTML is used to define the main content of a webpage. It is intended to contain the primary content of the document, excluding any content that is repeated across multiple pages, such as navigation menus or headers.

        The <main> tag should be used only once per page, and it should not be nested within other sectioning elements such as <article>, <section>, or <aside>.
