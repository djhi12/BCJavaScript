        The HTML title tag is a crucial element of a web page's head section. It is used to define the title of the page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab. The title tag also appears in search engine results as the clickable link to the webpage.
    -->

    <!-- 
        The syntax for the HTML title tag is as follows:

        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
    -->

    
    <!--
        You can replace "Page Title" with the actual title of your web page. It is recommended to use descriptive and concise titles that accurately reflect the content of the page. It's also a good idea to include relevant keywords to help search engines understand what the page is about. The title tag should be placed within the <head> section of the HTML document.
