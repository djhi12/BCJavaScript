<!--
    In HTML, a DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser what version of HTML the web page is written in. It must be included at the beginning of an HTML document, before any other content.

    This declaration specifies that the web page is written in the latest version of HTML, which is HTML5. The DOCTYPE declaration is important because it tells the browser how to interpret the HTML code and render the page correctly. Without a DOCTYPE declaration, the browser may not know how to handle certain HTML elements or features, leading to rendering errors or inconsistencies across different browsers.
