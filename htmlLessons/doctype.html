    <!--
        The HTML doctype declaration is an instruction that specifies the version of HTML used in a web page. It should be placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. The purpose of the doctype is to inform the web browser which version of HTML to use in rendering the page, and to ensure that the page is rendered correctly.
    -->

    <!-- 
        There are different doctype declarations for different versions of HTML. For example, the doctype for HTML5 is:

        <!DOCTYPE html> 
    -->

    <!-- This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. The doctype declaration is case-insensitive and must be written in uppercase letters for it to be recognized by the browser. -->
