<!--
    In HTML, the <body> tag is used to define the content of a web page. It is a required tag and typically appears after the <head> tag.

    The content of the web page, such as text, images, and other elements, is placed within the <body> tag. This tag serves as a container for all the visible elements of the web page, and it is where most of the HTML code will be placed.
