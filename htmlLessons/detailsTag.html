        The <details> tag is an HTML element used to create an interactive widget that allows you to hide or show additional content. It is often used in conjunction with the <summary> tag, which provides a heading or title for the details widget.

        Here's an example of how to use the <details> tag:
    -->

    <details>
        <summary>Click me to reveal more information</summary>
        <p>This is the hidden content that will be shown when the summary is clicked.</p>
    </details>

    <!--
        In the example above, the <details> element contains a <summary> element that serves as the clickable heading for the details widget. When the summary is clicked, the hidden content within the <details> element is revealed.

        The appearance and behavior of the <details> tag may vary slightly depending on the browser, but it generally displays as a clickable summary followed by the hidden content.

        You can also use CSS to style the <details> and <summary> elements to customize their appearance. For example, you can change the colors, fonts, and other visual aspects to match the design of your webpage.

        It's worth noting that the <details> tag is supported by most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, as with any HTML element, it's always a good practice to test your web pages across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
