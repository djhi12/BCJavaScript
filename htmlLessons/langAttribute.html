    The lang attribute is an HTML attribute used to specify the language of the content in a web page. This attribute is important for search engine optimization and accessibility, as it helps search engines and screen readers to correctly identify and understand the language of the content.

    The lang attribute is typically used in the <html> tag of a web page, and its value should be a two-letter language code, such as "en" for English, "fr" for French, or "es" for Spanish. For example:

    In this example, the lang attribute is set to "en" to indicate that the content of the web page is in English. It's important to note that the lang attribute should be set to the language of the content, not the language of the user interface or the country where the content is hosted.
