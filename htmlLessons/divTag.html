    <!--
        The HTML <div> tag is used to create a container element that is used to group other HTML elements and apply styles to them. The <div> tag is an empty container, meaning it does not have any default content or formatting. It is commonly used in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to create layouts and structure on a webpage.
    -->

    <!-- Here is an example of how the <div> tag can be used: -->
    <div>
        <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- In this example, the <div> element contains a heading and a paragraph. By using CSS, you can apply styles to the entire container, such as setting a background color or adding padding and margins. Additionally, you can add an ID or class attribute to the <div> element to further specify its styling or functionality. -->
