<!--
    In HTML, the <div> tag is a container element that is used to group together other HTML elements and apply styles or manipulate them using JavaScript.

    The content between the opening and closing <div> tags can include any other HTML elements, such as text, images, videos, and other HTML elements. The <div> tag itself does not have any specific styling or properties, but it can be styled using CSS to change its appearance and behavior.

    The <div> tag is commonly used to group together related elements, create columns or rows in a layout, apply a background color or image to a section of a webpage, or apply JavaScript to manipulate the content within the <div> element.
