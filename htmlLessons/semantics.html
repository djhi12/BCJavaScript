    <!--
        In HTML, "semantics" refers to the meaning or purpose behind the elements and tags used to structure a web page.

        Semantic HTML aims to create web pages with a clear structure that communicates the meaning and purpose of the content to both humans and machines (e.g., search engines, screen readers, etc.). This involves using HTML tags and attributes that accurately describe the content they contain.

        For example, using the <h1> tag to indicate the main heading of a page, <nav> to indicate the navigation section, <article> to indicate a self-contained piece of content, and so on.

        By using semantic HTML, web developers can improve the accessibility, usability, and search engine optimization of their websites.
