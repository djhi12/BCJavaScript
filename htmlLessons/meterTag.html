        The meter tag in HTML is used to create a control for indicating a scalar measurement within a known range. It is commonly used to display the progress of a task or the amount of a resource that has been used, such as disk space or bandwidth.

        The meter tag requires two attributes: min and max, which define the minimum and maximum values for the measurement. It also has a value attribute, which specifies the current value of the measurement.

        Here is an example of how to use the meter tag:
    -->

    <label for="storage">Storage used:</label>
    <meter id="storage" min="0" max="100" value="15">75%</meter>

    <!--
        In this example, the meter tag is used to display the amount of storage used, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 100. The current value is set to 75, and the text "75%" is displayed inside the meter bar.

        The meter tag also supports a number of optional attributes, such as low, high, and optimum, which can be used to specify thresholds for the measurement. These thresholds can be used to change the appearance of the meter, such as by changing the color or width of the bar.

        Overall, the meter tag is a useful tool for displaying measurements in a clear and visually appealing way, and is supported by all major web browsers.
