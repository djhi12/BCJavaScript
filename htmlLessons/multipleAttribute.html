        The "multiple" attribute in HTML is used with the <select> element to allow users to select multiple options from a dropdown list. By default, the <select> element allows users to select only one option at a time. However, by adding the "multiple" attribute, you can enable multiple selections.

        Here's an example of how you can use the "multiple" attribute in HTML:
    -->

    <select title="sample" multiple>
        <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
        <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
        <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
        <option value="option4">Option 4</option>
    </select>

    <!--
        In the above example, the <select> element has the "multiple" attribute, which allows users to select multiple options by holding down the Ctrl (or Command on Mac) key while clicking on the options. The selected options can then be accessed using JavaScript to perform further actions or retrieve their values.

        It's important to note that when the "multiple" attribute is present, the browser will render the dropdown as a list that allows multiple selections. The exact appearance may vary depending on the browser and operating system.
