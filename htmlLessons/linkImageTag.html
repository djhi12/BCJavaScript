    <!-- 
        To create a link with an image in HTML, you can use the "a" (anchor) tag and the "img" (image) tag together, like this: 
    -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com"><img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description"></a>

    <!-- In this example, replace "https://www.example.com" with the URL you want the link to go to, and "image.jpg" with the filename of the image you want to use. You can also add an "alt" attribute to provide a text description of the image for accessibility purposes. -->


    <!--
        Note that the image must be saved in the same folder as your HTML file or in a folder within that folder. If the image is saved elsewhere, you will need to provide the full URL of the image in the "src" attribute.
    -->
