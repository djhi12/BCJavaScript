    <!--
        The contenteditable attribute is an HTML attribute that allows you to make an element editable by the user. When you apply the contenteditable attribute to an HTML element, such as a <div> or a <span>, the user can modify the content of that element directly in the browser.

        Here's an example of how you can use the contenteditable attribute:
    -->

    <div contenteditable="true">
        This content can be edited by the user.
    </div>

    <!--
        In this example, the <div> element has the contenteditable attribute set to "true". This means that the content of the <div> can be modified by the user. The user can click inside the <div> and edit the text directly in the browser, just like in a text editor.

        You can also use JavaScript to interact with the editable content and perform actions based on user input. For example, you can listen for the input event to detect changes in the content and execute custom logic accordingly.
    -->

    <div contenteditable="true" id="editableDiv">
        This content can be edited by the user.
    </div>

    <script>
        var editableDiv = document.getElementById('editableDiv');

        editableDiv.addEventListener('input', function () {
            console.log('Content changed:', editableDiv.innerText);
            // Perform additional actions or updates based on user input
        });
    </script>

    <!--
        In this JavaScript example, an event listener is added to the editable <div> to listen for the input event. When the user modifies the content, the event is triggered, and the callback function logs the new content to the console. You can perform further operations or updates based on the user's input.

        The contenteditable attribute can be a useful feature when you want to allow users to edit content directly in the browser without requiring a separate input field or form. However, it's important to implement appropriate security measures and input validation to prevent malicious or unexpected user input.
