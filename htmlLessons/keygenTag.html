    <title>keygen tag</title>

<body>
    <!--
        The <keygen> tag in HTML is an obsolete and deprecated tag that was used to generate a cryptographic key pair. It was primarily used in web forms to provide a convenient way for users to generate a key pair for authentication or encryption purposes.

        However, the <keygen> tag is no longer recommended for use as it has been removed from the HTML specification and is not supported in most modern web browsers. Instead, it is recommended to use JavaScript libraries or server-side technologies to handle cryptographic operations.

        If you're looking for a way to handle cryptographic operations in a web application, consider using modern methods such as the Web Cryptography API or utilizing encryption libraries in server-side languages like Node.js (e.g., crypto module) or PHP (e.g., OpenSSL).

        Here's an example of using the Web Cryptography API to generate a key pair in JavaScript:
    -->

    <script>
        // Generate an RSA key pair
        window.crypto.subtle.generateKey(
            {
                name: 'RSA-OAEP',
                modulusLength: 2048,
                publicExponent: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x00, 0x01]), // 65537
                hash: 'SHA-256',
            },
            true, // extractable
            ['encrypt', 'decrypt'] // key usages
        )
            .then((keyPair) => {
                console.log('Key pair generated:', keyPair);
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                console.error('Error generating key pair:', error);
            });
    </script>

    <!--
        Remember to handle the generated key pair securely, and consult appropriate cryptographic standards and best practices for your specific use case.
