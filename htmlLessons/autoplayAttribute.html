    <!--
        The autoplay attribute in HTML is used to specify that an audio or video element should start playing as soon as it's loaded, without requiring any user interaction. When the autoplay attribute is added to an <audio> or <video> tag, the media will begin playing automatically.

        Here's an example of how to use the autoplay attribute with an HTML <video> element:
    -->

    <video src="video.mp4" autoplay>
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <!--
        In this example, the autoplay attribute is added to the <video> tag, and the src attribute specifies the path to the video file. The text "Your browser does not support the video tag" is displayed if the browser doesn't support the <video> element.

        It's important to note that autoplaying media can be disruptive to the user experience, as it may start playing unexpectedly and consume bandwidth. As a result, many browsers have implemented restrictions on autoplay behavior. For example, most modern browsers only allow autoplay if certain conditions are met, such as if the media is muted or if the user has interacted with the site in some way.

        To ensure the best user experience, it's recommended to follow the guidelines and restrictions set by the browsers regarding autoplay.
