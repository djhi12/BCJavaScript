        In HTML, the "h1" to "h6" tags are used to define headings of different sizes and levels of importance on a web page. These tags stand for "heading level 1" to "heading level 6", with "h1" being the largest and most important heading, and "h6" being the smallest and least important.

        Here's an example of how to use the "h1" to "h6" tags in HTML: 
    -->

    <h1>This is a level 1 heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a level 2 heading</h2>
    <h3>This is a level 3 heading</h3>
    <h4>This is a level 4 heading</h4>
    <h5>This is a level 5 heading</h5>
    <h6>This is a level 6 heading</h6>

    <!-- You can adjust the size and style of the headings using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to fit your desired look and feel of the web page. -->
