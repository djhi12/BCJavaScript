        The <label> tag in HTML is used to associate a text label with a form element. It is typically used in conjunction with input elements like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, etc., to provide a textual description or caption for the corresponding input field.

        Here's an example of how the <label> tag is used:
    -->

    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username">

    <!--
        In this example, the <label> element is used to label the "Username" input field. The for attribute of the <label> tag is used to specify which form element it is associated with. The id attribute of the input field matches the for attribute value of the <label>, creating a connection between them. When a user clicks on the label, the corresponding form element receives focus or activation.

        The <label> tag can also be used by wrapping the form element within the <label> tags, like this:
    -->

    <label>
        Username:
        <input type="text" name="username">
    </label>

    <!--
        In this case, the text "Username:" is automatically associated with the enclosed input field.

        Using the <label> tag has several benefits, including improved accessibility and usability. It helps screen readers associate labels with form controls and allows users to click on the label text to focus on the corresponding input field, making it easier to interact with forms.
