    <!--
        The HTML "a" tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to create a hyperlink that can be clicked by users to navigate to another web page, file, or location on the same page. The syntax for the "a" tag is:
    -->

    <a href="URL">Link Text</a>

    <!-- where "href" is the attribute that specifies the URL or location of the resource being linked to, and "Link Text" is the text that will be displayed as the clickable link on the page. -->


    <!-- Here's an example of an "a" tag in action: -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

    <!--
        This will create a hyperlink that says "Visit Example.com" and when clicked, will take the user to the website specified by the URL attribute, which in this case is "https://www.example.com".
    -->
