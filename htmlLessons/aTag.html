    In HTML, the "a" tag is used to create a hyperlink, or a clickable link, on a web page. 
    
    The "href" attribute specifies the destination URL that the link will lead to when clicked. The "link text" is the visible text that appears on the web page and can be clicked to navigate to the URL.
