        The <dl> tag in HTML is used to define a description list. It consists of a series of term-description pairs. Each term is represented by the <dt> tag, and each description is represented by the <dd> tag.

        Here's an example of how the <dl> tag can be used:
    -->

    <dl>
        <dt>Term 1</dt>
        <dd>Description 1</dd>

        <dt>Term 2</dt>
        <dd>Description 2</dd>

        <dt>Term 3</dt>
        <dd>Description 3</dd>
    </dl>

    <!--
        In the example above, we have three term-description pairs. The terms "Term 1," "Term 2," and "Term 3" are defined using the <dt> tag, and their corresponding descriptions "Description 1," "Description 2," and "Description 3" are defined using the <dd> tag.

        The <dl> element is often used to display glossaries, lists of definitions, or other types of term-description pairs. It provides a semantic structure to the content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the relationship between the terms and their descriptions.

        It's worth noting that the terms and descriptions within a <dl> can be styled using CSS to achieve a desired visual appearance on the web page.
