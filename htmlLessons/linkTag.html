    <!-- 
        The HTML link tag is used to define a hyperlink that links one document to another. It is written using the <a> tag and has the following syntax: 
    -->
    <a href="URL">Link text</a>

    <!-- The "href" attribute specifies the URL of the page or file you want to link to, and the "Link text" is the text that appears as the hyperlink on the web page. -->


    <!-- For example, the following code creates a hyperlink to the Google homepage: -->
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>

    <!-- 
        When a user clicks on the "Go to Google" link, their web browser will navigate to the Google homepage. 
    -->
