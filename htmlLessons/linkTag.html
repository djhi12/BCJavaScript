<!--
    In HTML, the "link" tag is used to define a relationship between the current document and an external resource, such as a stylesheet, a web font, or an icon. 

    Here, the "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource, "type" specifies the type of the linked resource (in this case, a stylesheet), and "href" specifies the URL of the linked resource.

    Other uses of the "link" tag include linking to web fonts using the "rel" attribute value of "preload" or "stylesheet", and linking to icons using the "rel" attribute value of "icon" and specifying the icon's size using the "sizes" attribute.
