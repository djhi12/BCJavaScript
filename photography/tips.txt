If you're a beginner in photography, here are some tips that can help you improve your skills:

Get to know your camera: Read your camera manual and learn about the different settings and functions. Experiment with different modes and settings to get a better understanding of how they work.

Use natural light: When possible, try to use natural light for your photos. Avoid using the built-in flash as much as possible, as it can produce harsh and unflattering light.

Focus on composition: Think about the composition of your photos before you take them. Pay attention to the rule of thirds, leading lines, and symmetry. Experiment with different angles and perspectives.

Keep it simple: Don't try to cram too much into your photos. Instead, focus on one or two subjects and keep the background simple and uncluttered.

Practice, practice, practice: Take lots of photos and experiment with different techniques. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, as this is how you'll learn and improve.

Edit your photos: Once you've taken your photos, spend some time editing them. You can use software like Lightroom or Photoshop to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color of your photos.

Share your work: Share your photos with others and seek feedback. Join online communities and groups where you can share your work and get feedback from other photographers.

Remember that photography is an art form, and there are no strict rules or formulas to follow. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things, and most importantly, have fun!
