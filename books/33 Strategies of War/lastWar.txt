"Do not fight the last war" is one of the strategies of war discussed in Robert Greene's book, "The 33 Strategies of War." The idea behind this strategy is that when facing a new conflict, it is important not to base your tactics solely on what worked in the past. Each conflict is unique, and what worked in the past may not necessarily work in the present.

To avoid fighting the last war, it is important to study the current situation carefully and objectively. This requires a willingness to set aside preconceptions and assumptions, and to approach the situation with a fresh perspective. It is also important to be flexible and adaptable, to be willing to change tactics as the situation evolves.

By avoiding the trap of fighting the last war, you can stay ahead of your opponents and be better prepared for whatever challenges come your way. This strategy can be applied not only in warfare but also in other areas of life, such as business, politics, and personal relationships.
