"Envelop the Enemy" is one of the 33 strategies of war described in the book "The 33 Strategies of War" by Robert Greene. The strategy involves surrounding the enemy and cutting off all of their supply lines, communication channels, and escape routes, thus making it difficult for them to escape or survive.

Enveloping the enemy is a strategy that has been used in many historical battles, such as the Battle of Cannae, where the Carthaginian general Hannibal used it to defeat a much larger Roman army. By enveloping the Roman army, Hannibal was able to cut off their communication and supply lines and trap them in a deadly circle.

To use the strategy of enveloping the enemy, you need to have a clear understanding of the terrain, the location of your enemy's forces, and their strengths and weaknesses. You should also have a plan to cut off their communication and supply lines and prevent them from escaping.

One way to envelop the enemy is to divide your forces into two or more groups and surround the enemy from different directions. Another way is to use deception to draw the enemy into a trap and then surround them. It's also important to have a strong logistical plan in place to ensure that your own forces have the necessary supplies to withstand a prolonged siege.

Overall, the strategy of enveloping the enemy is a powerful tactic that can lead to a decisive victory if executed correctly. However, it requires careful planning, coordination, and execution to be successful.
