"Defeat them in detail" is a strategy discussed in Robert Greene's book "The 33 Strategies of War." The idea behind this strategy is to break down the enemy's forces into smaller, more manageable units, and then defeat each one individually. By doing so, you can avoid fighting the enemy's full strength at once and increase your chances of victory.

Here are some tactics that you can use to apply the "defeat them in detail" strategy:

    Divide and conquer: Split the enemy's forces into smaller groups by using diversionary tactics or by creating dissension among the ranks.

    Use reconnaissance: Gather intelligence on the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, and use that information to identify the weakest points in their defenses.

    Focus on the weaker enemy: Identify and target the weakest of the enemy's forces first, and then work your way up to the strongest.

    Isolate the enemy: Cut off the enemy's supply lines and communication channels to isolate them from their allies and weaken their morale.

    Disrupt their command structure: Target the enemy's leaders and decision-makers to create chaos and confusion within their ranks.

    Use surprise and deception: Attack the enemy when and where they least expect it, and use deception to confuse and misdirect their forces.

By applying these tactics, you can successfully defeat the enemy in detail and increase your chances of victory in any conflict.
