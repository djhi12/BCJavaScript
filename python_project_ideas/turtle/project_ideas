Square Spiral: Create a program that uses the Turtle module to draw a square spiral. Each side of the square should increase in length, creating a spiral effect.

Spirograph: Create a program that generates beautiful spirograph-like patterns using Turtle graphics. Experiment with different parameters to create unique designs.

Fractal Trees: Implement a program that draws fractal trees using recursion. Each branch should split into smaller branches, creating an intricate tree-like structure.

Snowflake Generator: Design a program that generates snowflake patterns using Turtle graphics. Use recursion to create intricate and symmetric snowflakes.

Maze Generator and Solver: Build a program that generates a random maze using Turtle graphics. Then, implement an algorithm to solve the maze and visualize the solution path.

Animated Name: Write a program that animates your name using Turtle graphics. Each letter should be drawn in a unique style and move across the screen in an interesting way.

Solar System: Create a program that simulates the solar system using Turtle graphics. Draw the sun, planets, and moons, and animate their movements around the sun.

Spirograph Clock: Design a program that combines a spirograph and a clock. The program should draw changing patterns while displaying the current time.

Kaleidoscope: Implement a kaleidoscope effect using Turtle graphics. Draw a shape and use symmetry to create intricate and mesmerizing patterns.

Bouncing Balls: Build a program that simulates bouncing balls using Turtle graphics. Each ball should have its own movement pattern and interact with the walls of the window.

Turtle Race: Create a game where multiple turtles compete in a race. Use Turtle graphics to animate the turtles' movements and determine the winner based on their positions.

Remember, these are just starting points, and you can always add your own creative twists to these projects. Have fun exploring Turtle graphics and experimenting with Python!
