/*
    CSS3 is the latest version of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS3 builds upon the previous versions of CSS and includes new features and capabilities to enable designers and developers to create more dynamic and sophisticated web pages.

    Some of the notable features of CSS3 include:

        Selectors: CSS3 introduces new selectors that allow developers to target elements based on their relationship to other elements in the document, such as the first child, last child, and nth-child selectors.

        Animations: CSS3 allows developers to create animations and transitions using the @keyframes rule and the transition property. This makes it possible to create complex animations without the need for JavaScript or Flash.

        Media Queries: CSS3 includes media queries, which allow developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or browser that is being used to view the page. This makes it possible to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

        Borders and Backgrounds: CSS3 includes new options for styling borders and backgrounds, including gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, and box shadows.

        Typography: CSS3 includes new features for controlling typography, including web fonts, text shadows, and text-stroke.

    Overall, CSS3 provides a powerful toolset for creating modern, responsive, and visually appealing web pages.
