        In CSS, the ":disabled" pseudo-class is used to select and style form elements that are in a disabled state. Disabled elements are those that cannot be interacted with or edited by the user.

    <h1>Disabled Elements Example</h1>

    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" disabled>

    <br>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email">

    <br>

    <button type="button" disabled>Submit</button>

    <!--
        In this example, we have an HTML form with three elements: a disabled text input field, an enabled email input field, and a disabled button. The CSS code within the <style> tags selects and styles the disabled elements by using the input:disabled selector.

        When you open this HTML file in a browser, you'll see that the disabled elements (the "Name" input field and the "Submit" button) appear with reduced opacity and have a "not-allowed" cursor, indicating that they are disabled and cannot be interacted with.
