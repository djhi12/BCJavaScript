        In CSS, the ":optional" pseudo-class is used to select form elements that do not have the "required" attribute. It targets form elements such as input fields, select boxes, and text areas that are optional or not required to be filled out by the user.

        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

        <label for="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

    <!--
        In this example, we have a form with three fields: "Name," "Email," and "Message." The "Name" and "Message" fields have the "required" attribute, indicating that they must be filled out by the user. However, the "Email" field does not have the "required" attribute, making it an optional field.

        Now, you can apply CSS styles to the optional fields using the ":optional" pseudo-class as mentioned earlier. For instance, let's say you want to add a different background color to the optional fields:
