        In CSS, the :focus pseudo-class is used to select an element that is currently being focused by the user. It is commonly used in combination with interactive elements like form fields, buttons, and links.

        When an element receives focus, typically by clicking on it or navigating to it using the keyboard, it gains a focus state. The :focus pseudo-class allows you to apply specific styles to that element when it is in focus.

    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="text" id="email" name="email">

    <label for="message">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea>

    <!--
        In this example, we have a simple HTML form with three input fields: Name, Email, and Message. The CSS code inside the <style> tags applies styles to the text input fields when they are in focus.

        When you run this code in a browser and click on any of the text input fields, you will notice that the focused input field gets a blue border and a light blue background, as specified by the :focus pseudo-class in the CSS code.

        Feel free to customize the CSS styles or add more elements to experiment further with the :focus pseudo-class in HTML and CSS.
