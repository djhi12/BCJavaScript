/*
    In CSS, the flex-basis property is used to set the initial size of a flex item before any available space is distributed among the flex items.

    The flex-basis property can be set using various units like pixels, ems, rems, percentages, and auto. The default value is auto, which means that the size of the flex item is based on its content.
