VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a technology that allows you to create a secure and private connection to a network over the internet.

When you connect to a VPN, your device creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the VPN server. This encrypted tunnel helps to protect your online privacy and security by hiding your IP address and encrypting your internet traffic.

This means that when you use a VPN, your internet activity is encrypted and secure, and your online privacy is protected from prying eyes. Additionally, a VPN can be used to access geo-restricted content, bypass internet censorship, and protect your online identity from hackers and cybercriminals.

There are many VPN tools available, both free and paid, that offer a range of features and functionalities. Here are some of the most popular VPN tools:

	1. NordVPN - A paid VPN service that offers strong encryption, no-logging policy, and a large server network.
	2. ExpressVPN - A paid VPN service that offers high-speed connections, strong encryption, and a wide range of server locations.
	3. CyberGhost VPN - A paid VPN service that offers strong encryption, no-logging policy, and a user-friendly interface.
