A proactive password auditor is a tool used to identify weak passwords in a system before they can be exploited by attackers. The tool works by performing automated scans of the system's password database, attempting to crack passwords using a variety of techniques such as dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and hybrid attacks.

The goal of the proactive password auditor is to identify weak passwords that could be easily guessed or cracked by attackers. Once these weak passwords are identified, they can be flagged for users to change or forced to be changed by system administrators.

In addition to identifying weak passwords, proactive password auditors can also help identify other security issues related to passwords, such as passwords that are reused across multiple accounts, passwords that have been stored in plaintext, or accounts with no password policies enforced.

Overall, a proactive password auditor can be a valuable tool in maintaining the security of a system by identifying and addressing weak passwords before they can be exploited by attackers.
