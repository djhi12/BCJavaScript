In Scratch, the "repeat" block is a control block used to repeat a set of instructions a certain number of times. Here's how to use it:

	1. Drag the "repeat" block from the Control category to your workspace.
	2. Enter the number of times you want to repeat the instructions into the space inside the block.
	3. Put the instructions you want to repeat inside the "repeat" block.

For example, if you want to make a sprite move 10 steps to the right 5 times, you would use the following code:

	1. Drag the "repeat" block to your workspace.
	2. Enter the number 5 inside the "repeat" block.
	3. Drag a "move 10 steps" block to the inside of the "repeat" block.
	4. Change the direction to "right" in the "move 10 steps" block.

Your code should look like this:

repeat(5)
    move(10) steps
 
When you run this code, the sprite will move 10 steps to the right 5 times.
