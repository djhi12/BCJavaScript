The "change y by" block in Scratch is a motion block that is used to change the position of a sprite on the y-axis by a certain number of units. To remove this block from a Scratch project, you can follow these steps:

	1. Open the Scratch project that contains the "change y by" block.
	2. Locate the block in your script. You can either find it by scrolling through the script or by using the search bar at the top of the coding area.
	3. Click on the block to select it.
	4. Press the delete key on your keyboard, or right-click on the block and select "delete" from the dropdown menu.
	5. The "change y by" block should now be removed from your script.

Alternatively, you can also replace the "change y by" block with another block that achieves the same result. For example, you can use the "set y to" block to set the sprite's y-position to a specific value, or you can use the "move" block to move the sprite a certain number of steps in a specific direction.
