The "delete this clone" block in Scratch is used to remove a specific clone of a sprite during the execution of a script. Here's how you can remove this block:

	1. Open the Scratch project that contains the "delete this clone" block.
	2. Go to the script that contains the "delete this clone" block.
	3. Click on the "delete this clone" block to select it.
	4. Press the "delete" key on your keyboard or right-click on the block and select "delete" from the context menu.
	5. Save your changes to the project.

Note: Removing the "delete this clone" block may affect the behavior of the script that uses it. Make sure you test your project thoroughly after making any changes.
