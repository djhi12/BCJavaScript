The "when key pressed" block in Scratch is used to trigger an event or action when a specific key on the keyboard is pressed. To delete this block, you can simply click on it and press the "delete" key on your keyboard or right-click on it and select "delete" from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can drag the block out of the workspace and drop it in the trash can icon located on the bottom right corner of the Scratch interface.
