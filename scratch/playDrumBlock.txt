In Scratch, the "play drum" block is used to add drum sounds to a project. To use the block, follow these steps:

    Open Scratch and start a new project or open an existing one.
    Select the "Sound" tab from the top of the Scratch interface.
    Click on the "Drums" option in the Sounds section.
    Drag the "play drum" block from the "Sound" section and drop it into the script area.
    Choose the drum sound you want to play by clicking on the dropdown menu in the block.
    You can change the tempo of the drum sound by changing the number in the block.

Here's an example script using the "play drum" block:

when flag clicked
play drum (1 v) for (0.1) beats
wait (0.1) seconds
play drum (1 v) for (0.1) beats
wait (0.1) seconds
play drum (1 v) for (0.1) beats

This script plays a drum sound three times with a short pause in between each sound.
