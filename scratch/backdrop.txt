Scratch is a programming language and an online community that allows users to create interactive stories, games, and animations. In Scratch, a backdrop is the background image or color that appears behind the sprites (characters) in a project.

To add a backdrop in Scratch:

	1. Click on the "Stage" icon located in the upper-right corner of the screen.
	2. Click on the "Choose a Backdrop" button.
	3. Select a backdrop from the library or upload your own image.
	4. Optionally, you can also edit the backdrop by using the paint editor, adding shapes, text, or even creating animations.

Once you have added a backdrop, you can then add sprites to the stage and program them to interact with the backdrop and with each other. Backdrops can be changed or switched during a project, allowing for more complex animations and storytelling.
