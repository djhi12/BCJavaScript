The "go to" block in Scratch is used to move the sprite to a specific location on the stage. To remove this block from your Scratch project, you can follow these steps:

	1. Open your Scratch project and locate the "go to" block in your code.
	2. Click on the "go to" block to select it.
	3. Press the "Delete" key on your keyboard, or right-click on the block and select "Delete" from the context menu.
	4. Any other blocks that reference the deleted "go to" block will need to be updated or removed as well, to ensure that your code still functions properly.

Note that removing the "go to" block may impact the behavior of your code and you may need to make changes to compensate for its absence.
