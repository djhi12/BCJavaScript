The "hide" block in Scratch is used to hide a sprite or a backdrop. You can find the "hide" block under the "Looks" category in the Scratch block palette.

To use the "hide" block, simply drag and drop it into your Scratch project and attach it to the sprite or backdrop that you want to hide. When the block is executed, the sprite or backdrop will become invisible.

It's worth noting that the "hide" block only makes the sprite or backdrop invisible, but it doesn't remove it from the stage. If you want to completely remove a sprite or backdrop from your project, you can use the "delete" block instead, which is also found in the "Looks" category.
