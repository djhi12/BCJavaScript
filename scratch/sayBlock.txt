The "say" block in Scratch is used to make the computer-generated voice speak out loud. To delete the "say" block in Scratch, you can follow these steps:

    Open the Scratch project that contains the "say" block.

    Click on the "say" block to select it.

    Press the delete key on your keyboard or right-click on the block and select "delete" from the menu.

    The "say" block will be removed from your project.

Alternatively, you can also remove the "say" block by dragging it out of your Scratch project and dropping it outside of the workspace.
