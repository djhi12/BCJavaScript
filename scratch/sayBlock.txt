In Scratch, the "say" block is used to make a sprite speak a message. To remove this block from your code, you can follow these steps:

	1. Click on the "say" block in your code to select it.
	2. Press the "Delete" key on your keyboard, or right-click on the block and select "delete" from the context menu.
	3. The "say" block will be removed from your code.

Alternatively, you can drag the "say" block out of your code area and drop it into the block palette to remove it.
