The "play note" block is a block in Scratch that allows you to play a musical note. To use it, follow these steps:

    Open Scratch and start a new project.
    Click on the "Sounds" tab in the lower-left corner of the screen.
    Click on the "Note" category to reveal the "play note" block.
    Click and drag the "play note" block to the script area.
    Choose the note you want to play by selecting a value for the "note" input. You can select the note by clicking on the drop-down menu and choosing a note or by typing in a value between 1 and 12.
    Choose the length of time you want the note to play by selecting a value for the "beats" input. You can select the length of time by clicking on the drop-down menu and choosing a value or by typing in a value between 1 and 4.
    Click on the green flag to run your program and hear the note.
    
You can also use the "play note until done" block if you want the note to play for the full length of time without any other actions in the script.
