        <h2 class="center">WHAT IS ENVIRONMENT?</h2>
        <p>
            The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally,
            meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth.
            This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources
            that affect human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be
            distinguished as components:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention,
                including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur
                within their boundaries and their nature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water,
                and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from
                civilized human actions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Natural environment is often used as a synonym for habitat, for instance, when we say that the natural
            environment of giraffes is the savanna.

                The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists.
                These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on
                our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global
                warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon
                dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and
                humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse
                effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of
                their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it
                back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which
                in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental
                Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the
                earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between
                1990 and 2100. Efforts have been increasingly focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases that are
                causing climatic changes, on developing adaptative strategies to global warming, to assist humans, other
                animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and nations in adjusting to the effects of global
                warming.
