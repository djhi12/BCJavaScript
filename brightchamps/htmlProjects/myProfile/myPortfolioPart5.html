        <h2>MY CITY</h2>
        <p>
            Delhi is one of the oldest cities in the world, and has been continuously inhabited since the 6th century
            BCE. Through most of its history, Delhi has served as a capital of various kingdoms and empires, most
            notably the Pandavas, the Tomars, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals. The city has been captured, ransacked
            and rebuilt several times, particularly during the medieval period, and modern Delhi is a cluster of a
            number of cities spread across the metropolitan region. For many centuries Delhi has been a dominant trading
            and commercial centre.

        <h3>Cricket</h3>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
            is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
            The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the
            wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the
            field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of
            dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding
            side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket
            with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been
            dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a
            third umpire and match referee in international matches.</p>

        <h3>Beautiful</h3>
        <p>Beauty is much more than how one looks on the outside. True beauty is found in conquering challenges, showing
            kindness, and spreading contagious laughter. Beautiful girls are empowered, smart, and really, really
            strong!</p>
        <p>Beautiful breaks barriers by showing girls free to be themselves: splashing in mud, conducting science
            experiments, and reading books under a flashlight with friends.</p>
