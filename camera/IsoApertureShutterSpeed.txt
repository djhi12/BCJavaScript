ISO, aperture, and shutter speed are the three main components of exposure in photography.

ISO refers to the sensitivity of the camera's sensor to light. A lower ISO number (e.g. 100) means that the sensor is less sensitive to light, while a higher ISO number (e.g. 1600) means that the sensor is more sensitive to light. Increasing the ISO can be useful in low-light situations, but it can also introduce more noise or grain to the image.

Aperture refers to the opening in the lens that allows light to enter the camera. It is measured in f-stops, with a smaller number indicating a wider aperture and a larger number indicating a narrower aperture. A wider aperture (e.g. f/1.8) allows more light to enter the camera and can create a shallow depth of field, while a narrower aperture (e.g. f/16) lets in less light and can create a greater depth of field.

Shutter speed refers to the amount of time that the camera's shutter remains open when taking a photo. It is measured in seconds or fractions of a second, such as 1/100 or 1/1000. A faster shutter speed (e.g. 1/1000) can freeze motion and create sharp images, while a slower shutter speed (e.g. 1/30) can create motion blur and a sense of movement in the image.

These three components work together to determine the overall exposure of an image. Changing any one of these settings will affect the other two, so it is important to balance them properly to achieve the desired effect.
