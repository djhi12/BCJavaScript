Reels are a feature on the social media platform Instagram that allows users to create short-form videos up to 60 seconds in length. Reels were launched in August 2020 as a response to the popularity of short-form video content on platforms like TikTok.

Users can create Reels by selecting the Reels camera option in the Instagram app and then recording or uploading a video. Reels can be edited with music, text, and various effects. They can be shared on a user's profile, in their stories, or on the Explore page, which showcases popular Reels from around the platform.

Reels are a popular way for users to showcase their creativity and engage with their followers. They are also a valuable tool for businesses and influencers looking to reach a wider audience and increase engagement on their profiles.
