TikTok is a social media app that allows users to create, share, and discover short videos. It was developed by the Chinese company ByteDance and was launched in September 2016 under the name Douyin in China. The app became available globally as TikTok in September 2017.

TikTok is popular for its short-form videos that are typically 15 seconds long, but can also be up to one minute long. Users can create videos with various filters, effects, and soundtracks. The app uses artificial intelligence to suggest videos based on a user's viewing history and preferences.

TikTok has become a cultural phenomenon, with millions of users worldwide and has been credited with launching the careers of numerous social media influencers. However, it has also faced scrutiny for privacy and security concerns, particularly related to its data collection practices and its ties to the Chinese government.
