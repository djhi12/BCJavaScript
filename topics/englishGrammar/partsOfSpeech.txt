Parts of speech are the basic categories that words are classified into according to their grammatical function in a sentence. There are nine parts of speech in English, which are:

    Noun: a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Examples include "dog," "book," "friend," and "happiness."

    Verb: a word that expresses an action or a state of being. Examples include "run," "sing," "think," and "is."

    Adjective: a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun. Examples include "red," "tall," "happy," and "interesting."

    Adverb: a word that describes or modifies a verb, adjective, or other adverb. Examples include "quickly," "very," "often," and "well."

    Pronoun: a word that takes the place of a noun or noun phrase. Examples include "he," "she," "they," and "it."

    Preposition: a word that shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. Examples include "in," "on," "with," and "under."

    Conjunction: a word that connects words, phrases, or clauses. Examples include "and," "but," "or," and "so."

    Interjection: a word or phrase that expresses strong emotion or surprise. Examples include "ouch," "wow," "oh," and "hey."

    Determiner: a word that provides information about a noun, such as its quantity or ownership. Examples include "the," "a," "an," and "my."

Understanding the parts of speech is essential for understanding how words function in a sentence and for constructing grammatically correct sentences.


Here are some examples of sentences with each part of speech:

    Noun: The cat chased the mouse.

    Verb: She sings beautifully.

    Adjective: The old car is rusty.

    Adverb: He ran quickly to catch the bus.

    Pronoun: She gave me the book to read.

    Preposition: The book is on the table.

    Conjunction: She is smart, but lazy.

    Interjection: Wow, that's amazing!

    Determiner: My car is parked outside.

Note that some words can function as different parts of speech depending on how they are used in a sentence. For example, "run" can be a verb (She runs every morning), a noun (She went for a run), or an adjective (She has a run in her stockings). Similarly, "book" can be a noun (I read a book), a verb (I will book a flight), or an adjective (I have a book report due).
