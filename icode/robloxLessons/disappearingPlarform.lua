-- The first line of the code creates a local variable called "vanisher" and assigns it the value of a part named "Part2" which is a child of a part called "DisappearingPlatform" in the Workspace of the game.
local vanisher = game.Workspace.DisappearingPlatform.Part2 


-- The "disappear()" function sets the "CanCollide" property of the "vanisher" part to false, which means that other objects in the game cannot collide with it, and sets the "Transparency" property to 1, which makes the part completely transparent. 
local function disappear()
	vanisher.CanCollide = false
	vanisher.Transparency = 1
end


-- The "appear()" function does the opposite: it sets the "CanCollide" property to true and the "Transparency" property to 0, which makes the part completely visible.
local function appear()
	vanisher.CanCollide = true
	vanisher.Transparency = 0
end


-- The last part of the code uses a while loop that will run indefinitely (because the condition "true" is always true). Inside the loop, the code waits for 3 seconds using the "wait()" function, then calls the "disappear()" function to make the platform disappear. After another 3 seconds, it calls the "appear()" function to make the platform reappear. This loop will continue to run indefinitely, causing the platform to appear and disappear every 3 seconds.
while true do
	wait(3)
	disappear()
	wait(3)
	appear()
end
