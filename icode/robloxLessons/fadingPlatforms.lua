local fader = game.Workspace.FadingPlatformFolder.FadingPlatform -- The code first creates a local variable called fader and assigns it to the FadingPlatform object located in the Workspace's FadingPlatformFolder. This variable is used throughout the code to refer to the FadingPlatform.

local isTouched = false -- The code creates another local variable called isTouched and initializes it to false. This variable is used to keep track of whether the FadingPlatform has been touched by a player.

local function fade() -- The code defines a new function called fade(). This function is triggered when the FadingPlatform is touched by a player.

    if not isTouched then -- This line checks if the FadingPlatform has not been touched before. If it has not, the code inside the if block will be executed.

        isTouched = true -- This line sets the isTouched variable to true, indicating that the FadingPlatform has been touched by a player.

        for count = 1, 10 do -- This line creates a for loop that runs from 1 to 10. Each iteration of the loop will reduce the transparency of the FadingPlatform by one tenth.

            fader.Transparency = count / 10 -- This line sets the transparency of the FadingPlatform to the current value of count divided by 10. This will gradually reduce the transparency of the FadingPlatform.

            wait(0.1) -- This line pauses the script for 0.1 seconds before continuing to the next iteration of the loop. This creates a pause between each change in transparency, making the fade effect smoother.
        end

        fader.CanCollide = false -- This line sets the CanCollide property of the FadingPlatform to false, making it non-solid. This allows players to pass through the FadingPlatform.

        wait(3) -- This line pauses the script for 3 seconds before continuing.

        fader.CanCollide = true -- This line sets the CanCollide property of the FadingPlatform back to true, making it solid again.

        fader.Transparency = 0 -- This line sets the transparency of the FadingPlatform back to 0, making it fully visible again.

        isTouched = false -- This line sets the isTouched variable back to false, allowing the FadingPlatform to be triggered again in the future.
    end
end

fader.Touched:Connect(fade) -- This line connects the fade() function to the Touched event of the FadingPlatform. When a player touches the FadingPlatform, the fade() function will be executed.
