JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is commonly used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It was originally created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

JavaScript is a client-side language, meaning that it is executed on the user's browser rather than on the web server. It is used to add interactivity to web pages by allowing developers to manipulate HTML, CSS, and the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic effects, animations, and user interactions.

JavaScript is also used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js, which allows developers to create server-side applications using the same language as client-side web development. This has led to the development of full-stack JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, which enable developers to build web applications entirely in JavaScript.

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications beyond web development, including game development, desktop applications, and even mobile app development through platforms like React Native. Its popularity has made it an essential skill for many developers and is often considered a prerequisite for front-end web development.
