Title: Introduction to Lua Programming

Objective:

Introduce campers to the basics of Lua programming language.
Teach campers how to write simple Lua programs.
Familiarize campers with the syntax and concepts of Lua programming.

Duration: 1 week (3 hours each day)

Materials Needed:
Computers or laptops with Lua programming environment installed
Projector or large screen for demonstrations
Printed handouts with code snippets and exercises


Day 1: Introduction to Lua Programming (1 hour)
Introduction to Lua programming language and its applications.
Explanation of Lua syntax, variables, and data types.
Demonstration of basic Lua program structure.
Guided hands-on exercise: Writing and running a simple "Hello, World!" program.
Day 2: Control Structures and Loops (1 hour)

Overview of control structures in Lua (if-else, while, for).
Explanation of conditional statements and logical operators.
Demonstration of control structures with example programs.
Guided hands-on exercise: Writing a program to check if a number is even or odd using if-else statements.
Day 3: Functions and Tables (1 hour)

Introduction to functions in Lua and their importance.
Explanation of function definition, parameters, and return values.
Demonstration of functions with example programs.
Introduction to tables as a data structure in Lua.
Guided hands-on exercise: Writing a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function.
Day 4: File Input/Output (1 hour)

Explanation of file handling in Lua.
Overview of file modes (read, write, append).
Demonstration of file input/output operations.
Guided hands-on exercise: Writing a program to read data from a file and perform simple operations on it.
Day 5: Mini Project (1 hour)

Recap of concepts learned during the week.
Campers will work on a mini project individually or in pairs.
Project options: creating a simple text-based game, implementing a calculator, or designing a basic inventory management system.
Encourage creativity and problem-solving skills.
Note: Throughout the week, allocate time for questions and provide assistance to campers as needed. Encourage campers to experiment with the concepts learned and explore additional features of Lua programming.

Evaluation:

Assess campers' understanding of Lua programming through observation, participation, and completion of exercises.
Evaluate the mini projects based on creativity, functionality, and adherence to programming principles.
Additional Tips:

Provide extra resources such as online tutorials or Lua documentation for campers interested in further exploring the language.
Encourage collaboration and peer learning among campers.
Celebrate achievements and progress at the end of the week.
