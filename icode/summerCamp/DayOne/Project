Project: Color-Changing Block

Objective: Create a block in Roblox Studio that changes color when clicked.

Instructions:
Open Roblox Studio and create a new place.

Insert a Part object into the workspace. This will serve as the block.

Select the Part object and open the Properties window.

In the Properties window, locate the "BrickColor" property and click the color swatch to choose an initial color for the block.

Insert a Script object into the Part.

Double-click the Script object to open the Lua editor.

Clear the existing code and write the following Lua script:

local part = script.Parent

local function changeColor()
    local currentColor = part.BrickColor
    local newColor = BrickColor.random()
    
    while newColor == currentColor do
        newColor = BrickColor.random()
    end
    
    part.BrickColor = newColor
end

part.ClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(changeColor)


Save the script and close the Lua editor.

Test the game by clicking the Play button in Roblox Studio.

Click the block, and you should see the color change randomly.

Explanation:
The Lua script creates a function named changeColor that will be called when the block is clicked.
Inside the function, it retrieves the current color of the block using part.BrickColor.

It then generates a new random color using BrickColor.random(). Note that we ensure the new color is different from the current color using a while loop.

Finally, it sets the part.BrickColor property to the new color, changing the block's appearance.

The part.ClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(changeColor) line connects the changeColor function to the block's click event so that it triggers when the block is clicked.

Feel free to modify and enhance this project as you become more comfortable with Lua programming and Roblox Studio. This is just a starting point to get you familiar with the basics of scripting interactions in Roblox games using Lua.
