For the Day 1 project, you can introduce the participants to Roblox Studio and have them create a simple game environment. Here's a project idea for Day 1:

Project: Create a Miniature Park

Objective: Build a miniature park scene using Roblox Studio.

Instructions:
Begin by explaining the concept of a miniature park and showing some examples to inspire creativity.
Guide the participants through the process of creating a new place in Roblox Studio.

Introduce them to basic building techniques such as resizing, rotating, and moving objects.

Demonstrate how to use different building tools and features to create the park scene, such as terrain editing, inserting models, and placing props.

Encourage participants to use their imagination and creativity to design the park elements like trees, flowers, paths, benches, and other decorative objects.

Provide guidance on selecting appropriate textures and materials to enhance the appearance of the park.
Remind participants to save their progress regularly and experiment with different camera angles to get a better view of their creation.

Allocate some time for participants to add finishing touches to their park, such as adding lighting effects and adjusting the terrain.

Once everyone has completed their miniature park, invite participants to share their creations with the rest of the group, highlighting unique features and creative elements.

Encourage participants to explore and interact with each other's parks, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.


Note: You can also consider incorporating a short discussion on game design elements during the project, such as creating a sense of immersion, incorporating gameplay elements, and thinking about the target audience for the park.
