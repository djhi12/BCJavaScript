For Day 4's focus on multiplayer games and networking, here's a simple project idea:

Project: "Capture the Flag"
Objective: Create a multiplayer game where players compete to capture and protect a flag.

Overview:
Start by designing a game environment with two teams, each having a base and a flag.

Players will join the game and be randomly assigned to one of the teams.

The objective is to capture the opposing team's flag and bring it back to your team's base while defending your own flag.

Implement game mechanics such as player movement, flag interaction, and scoring system.

Steps to Implement:

Set up the game environment:
Design two bases for each team, including defensive elements like walls or obstacles.
Place a flag in each base that players need to capture.

Implement player movement:
Enable players to move using keyboard controls or a virtual joystick.
Set boundaries within the game environment to prevent players from going outside the playable area.

Create flag interaction:
Allow players to interact with the flags by touching or clicking on them.
When a player touches an opponent's flag, it should detach and follow the player.
If a player carrying the flag is touched by an opponent, the flag should return to its original position.

Develop a scoring system:
Track the number of flags captured by each team.
When a player successfully brings a flag to their team's base, increase their team's score.
Display the scores on the screen for players to see.

Implement game rules and mechanics:
Add timers to limit the game duration.
Display messages or notifications when a flag is captured or returned.
Create a game ending condition, such as reaching a certain score or time running out.

Test the game:
Invite multiple players to join and test the multiplayer functionality.
Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.


By the end of Day 4, participants will have a working multiplayer game where they can compete against each other in a capture the flag-style game. They can continue to polish and refine their projects on Day 5 before showcasing them to others.
