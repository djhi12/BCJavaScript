Project Idea for Day 2: Game Design and Mechanics

Objective: Design and create a simple game with a unique mechanic.

Instructions:
Begin the day by discussing different game genres and mechanics with the camp participants. Talk about popular games and the unique mechanics that make them enjoyable.

Divide the participants into small groups or pairs.

Each group will brainstorm and come up with a game concept that incorporates a unique game mechanic. Encourage them to think outside the box and be creative.

Once the groups have their game concept, they should create a game design document that outlines the objectives, rules, challenges, and how the mechanic will be implemented.

Provide guidance and feedback as the groups work on their game designs.

After the game designs are finalized, the groups will move on to Roblox Studio to start building their games.

Guide the participants through the process of implementing the core mechanics of their games using Roblox Studio's tools and scripting.

Encourage them to iterate and playtest their games as they build to ensure that the mechanics are engaging and functioning as intended.

Towards the end of the day, each group will have the opportunity to present their game concept and demonstrate the unique mechanic to the rest of the camp participants.

Encourage feedback and discussions among the participants about each game's mechanics and design choices.


By the end of the day, the participants should have a working prototype of their game with a unique mechanic implemented. This project will allow them to apply their knowledge of game design principles and mechanics in a hands-on and creative manner.
