For Day 5, here's a simple project idea focused on game polishing and publishing:

Project: Create and Publish a Mini Obstacle Course Game

Objective: Design and develop a mini obstacle course game in Roblox Studio, polish its mechanics and aesthetics, and publish it on the Roblox platform.

Steps:

Game Concept: Discuss with the participants the concept of a mini obstacle course game. Encourage creativity and unique ideas for obstacles, power-ups, and level design.

Level Design: Have the participants create multiple levels for the obstacle course game using Roblox Studio. They can experiment with different types of obstacles, platforms, and challenges.

Game Mechanics: Instruct the participants to refine the game mechanics, such as player movement, jumping, and collision detection. Encourage them to add power-ups or special abilities to enhance the gameplay experience.

Aesthetics: Guide the participants in improving the visual appeal of the game. This can include designing appealing textures, adding decorative elements, and creating a consistent theme or atmosphere.

Audio Integration: Introduce participants to sound effects and background music. They can add appropriate audio cues for various actions and events in the game.

Testing and Polishing: Allocate time for participants to playtest their obstacle course game. Encourage them to identify and fix any bugs, adjust difficulty levels, and make necessary improvements based on feedback.

Game Title and Thumbnails: Help participants come up with an engaging game title and create attractive thumbnails to attract players on the Roblox platform.

Game Description and Tags: Instruct participants to write a compelling game description and add relevant tags to improve discoverability.

Publishing: Guide participants through the process of publishing their game on Roblox. Explain the importance of selecting appropriate settings and permissions.

Play and Share: Once the game is published, allow participants to play and share their creations with each other. Encourage them to gather feedback from their peers and make further improvements if desired.


By the end of Day 5, the participants should have a polished mini obstacle course game published on Roblox, ready for others to enjoy and play.
