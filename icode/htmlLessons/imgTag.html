    <!--
        The HTML <img> element is used to embed images into a web page. The <img> tag is an empty tag, which means it does not require a closing tag. Instead, it has attributes that are used to specify the source of the image, its dimensions, alt text, and other properties.
    -->

    <!-- Here is an example of how to use the <img> tag: -->
    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/02/27/16/10/flowers-276014__340.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset" width="500" height="300">

    <!-- In this example, the "src" attribute specifies the location of the image file. The "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is used by screen readers for accessibility. The "width" and "height" attributes define the dimensions of the image in pixels. -->

    <!--
        You can also include other attributes in the <img> tag, such as "title" to provide a tooltip when the user hovers over the image, or "class" and "id" to apply styles to the image using CSS.
    -->
