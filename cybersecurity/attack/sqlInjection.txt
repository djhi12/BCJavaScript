SQL injection is a type of cybersecurity attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with databases. In an SQL injection attack, an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a web form input or URL parameter, tricking the application into executing unintended SQL commands.

The consequences of an SQL injection attack can be severe. The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, modify or delete data in the database, or even take over the entire web application or server.

To prevent SQL injection attacks, web developers can use parameterized queries and prepared statements in their code, which separate user input from the SQL commands. It's also important to properly sanitize user input, validate input data, and limit database permissions to prevent attackers from accessing or modifying sensitive data.

Regularly testing web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities and keeping software up-to-date with security patches is also crucial in preventing these types of attacks. Additionally, using web application firewalls (WAFs) and other security tools can provide an added layer of protection against SQL injection and other cyber threats.
