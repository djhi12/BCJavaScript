An operating system (OS) is a software system that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the user applications. Some common examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix, and Android.

The operating system provides a variety of services, including managing the computer's memory, controlling input and output devices, managing files and folders, managing the network connections, and managing the computer's security. It also provides a user interface, allowing users to interact with the computer and run applications.

Different types of operating systems exist, including single-tasking, multi-tasking, real-time, and distributed operating systems. Single-tasking operating systems only allow one application to run at a time, while multi-tasking operating systems allow multiple applications to run simultaneously. Real-time operating systems are designed for systems that need to respond quickly to events, such as in industrial control systems, while distributed operating systems are designed to manage a network of computers and resources.
