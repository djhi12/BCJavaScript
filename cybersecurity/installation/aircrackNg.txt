After the process what will I do?
After installing aircrack-ng, you can use it to test the security of your wireless network or to audit the security of other wireless networks (with permission).

To use aircrack-ng, you'll need a wireless network adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection. You can check whether your adapter supports these features by running the following command in a terminal window:

iw list | grep "Supported interface modes" -A 8


If your adapter supports monitor mode and packet injection, you should see monitor and packet in the list of supported interface modes.

To use aircrack-ng to test the security of a wireless network, you'll need to put your wireless adapter into monitor mode, capture packets from the network, and then use aircrack-ng to analyze the captured packets and crack the network's WPA/WPA2-PSK passphrase (if possible).

Please note that using aircrack-ng to test the security of a wireless network without permission is illegal and can lead to serious consequences. Only use aircrack-ng on networks that you own or have permission to test.
