    Portability: Depending on your needs, you may want to consider a lightweight and portable laptop that is easy to carry around.

    Budget: The cost of laptops varies widely, so you'll need to decide on a budget that works for you.

    Based on these factors, some good options for a cybersecurity laptop include:

    Dell XPS 13: This laptop is powerful, lightweight, and comes with features like a fingerprint reader and hardware-based encryption.
