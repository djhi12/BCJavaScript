    <!--
        The "img" tag in HTML is used to embed images into a web page. Here is an example of how to use the "img" tag:
    -->

    <img src="image.jpg" alt="description of image">

    <!-- 
        In this example, "src" is the attribute that specifies the URL or file path of the image you want to display, while "alt" is the attribute that provides a text description of the image. The "alt" attribute is important for accessibility purposes, as it provides information about the image for users who cannot see it, such as those who use screen readers.
