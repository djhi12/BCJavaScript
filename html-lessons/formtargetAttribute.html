    <!--
        In HTML, the formtarget attribute is used to specify the browsing context or target window or frame where the form response should be displayed. It is used in conjunction with the <form> element and the target attribute on form submission elements such as <input type="submit">, <input type="image">, or <button type="submit">.

        The formtarget attribute can take the following values:

        _self: The form response will be displayed in the same window or frame where the form is located (default behavior).
        _blank: The form response will be displayed in a new, unnamed window or tab.
        _parent: The form response will be displayed in the parent window or frame of the current window or frame.
        _top: The form response will be displayed in the top-level browsing context, replacing any frames.
        <framename>: The form response will be displayed in the named frame. Replace <framename> with the name of the target frame.
        
            Here's an example usage of the formtarget attribute:
    -->

    <form action="submit-form.php" method="post" target="_blank">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" formtarget="_blank">
    </form>

    <!--
        In the example above, when the form is submitted, the form response will open in a new, unnamed window or tab due to the target="_blank" attribute on the <form> element. The formtarget="_blank" attribute on the submit button ensures that the response is displayed in the same target window or tab as the form submission.
    -->
