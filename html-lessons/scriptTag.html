    <!--
        The <script> tag in HTML is used to define a client-side script, such as JavaScript, that is executed by the web browser. The script can be included within the HTML document or it can be linked to an external script file using the src attribute.

        Here's an example of using the <script> tag to include a script within an HTML document:
    -->

    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <script>
        alert('Hello World!');
    </script>

    <!--
        In the above example, the <script> tag is used to include a script that displays an alert dialog with the message "Hello World!" when the page is loaded in the browser.

        And here's an example of using the <script> tag to link to an external script file:
    -->

    <script src="myscript.js"></script>
</body>
