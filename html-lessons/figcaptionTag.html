    <!--
        The <figcaption> tag is an HTML5 element that is used to provide a caption or description for an HTML <figure> element. The <figure> element is used to group related content, such as an image and its caption. The <figcaption> element is used to provide a text description or caption for the content within the <figure> element.

        Here is an example of how to use the <figure> and <figcaption> elements in HTML:
    -->

    <figure>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
        <figcaption>This is an example of a caption for the image.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!--
        In this example, the <figure> element contains an image, and the <figcaption> element provides a caption for the image. When the page is rendered in a web browser, the image and caption will be displayed together as a single unit.

        It is important to note that the <figcaption> element should always be used within a <figure> element. The <figure> element should also contain a <img> element, or some other form of media, that the caption describes.
