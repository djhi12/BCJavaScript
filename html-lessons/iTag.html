    <!--
        In HTML, the <i> tag is used to define and format text as italic. The "i" stands for "italic." It is a semantic tag that represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text and displayed in italic style.

        Here's an example of how the <i> tag can be used:
    -->

    <p>This is a <i>sample text</i> in italic.</p>

    <!--
        In the example above, the text "sample text" will be displayed in italic style when rendered in a web browser.

        It's important to note that the <i> tag is used for stylistic purposes, indicating that text should be displayed in an italic font. If you want to convey more semantic meaning, such as marking up text that should be emphasized, it is recommended to use the <em> tag instead. The <em> tag represents text that has stress or importance, and by default, it is typically displayed in italic style.
