        In HTML, the "readonly" attribute is used to make an input field or textarea read-only, meaning that the user can view the value but cannot modify it. It is commonly used when you want to display data that should not be edited by the user.

        Here's an example of how to use the "readonly" attribute in HTML:
    -->

    <input title ="sample" type="text" readonly value="Read-only Text Field">

    <!--
        In this example, the <input> element is used to create a text field, and the "readonly" attribute is added to make it read-only. The value attribute is used to specify the initial value of the field.

        Similarly, you can use the "readonly" attribute with <textarea> elements to make them read-only:
    -->

    <textarea title="sample" readonly>Read-only Textarea</textarea>

    <!--
        In both cases, the user will be able to see the content of the field but won't be able to modify it. The field will also appear visually different to indicate that it is read-only, usually with a grayed-out or disabled appearance depending on the browser's default styling.
    -->
