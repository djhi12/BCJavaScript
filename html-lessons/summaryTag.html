        The <summary> tag is an HTML element that is used in conjunction with the <details> element to create an interactive disclosure widget. It represents a summary, title, or heading for the content that can be expanded or collapsed.

        Here's an example of how to use the <summary> and <details> tags:
    -->

    <details>
        <summary>Click to expand</summary>
        <p>This is the hidden content that can be expanded or collapsed.</p>
    </details>

    <!--
        In the example above, the <details> element acts as a container for the content that can be expanded or collapsed. The <summary> element serves as the visible heading or summary for that content. When the user clicks on the summary, the content enclosed within the <details> element is revealed or hidden.

        It's important to note that the <summary> tag should always be placed as the first child of the <details> element for proper accessibility and compatibility with different browsers.

        You can further customize the appearance of the disclosure widget using CSS to style the <summary> and <details> elements according to your needs.
