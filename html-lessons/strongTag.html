    <!--
        In HTML, the "strong" tag is used to indicate that the enclosed text should be displayed with strong emphasis. This typically results in the text being displayed in bold font.
    -->

    <p>This is a <strong>strongly emphasized</strong> sentence.</p>

    <!--
        In this example, the words "strongly emphasized" would be displayed in bold font because they are enclosed within the "strong" tags. It's important to note that the "strong" tag should be used for semantic emphasis rather than just to make text bold. This helps ensure that your HTML code is accessible to users with different needs, such as those using screen readers.
