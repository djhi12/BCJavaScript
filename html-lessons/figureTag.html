        The HTML "figure" element is used to display a self-contained image, illustration, diagram, or video, with an optional caption or legend. It is typically used for graphical content that is not part of the main flow of the document, such as sidebars or images that are decorative or illustrative rather than essential to the content.

        The "figure" element is usually paired with a "figcaption" element, which provides the caption or legend for the figure. The "figcaption" element should be placed immediately after the "figure" element.

        Here's an example of how to use the "figure" element in HTML:
    -->

    <figure>
        <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
        <figcaption>An example image with a caption.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <!--
        In this example, the "figure" element contains an "img" element, which displays the image, and a "figcaption" element, which provides the caption for the image. Note that the "alt" attribute of the "img" element provides alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility purposes.
    -->
