    <!--
        The <cite> tag in HTML is used to indicate a citation or reference to a creative work, such as a book, article, or film. It is typically used to identify the title of the work being cited.

    <p>According to <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite>, "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since" (Fitzgerald 1).</p>

    <!--
        In this example, the <cite> tag is used to indicate that the quoted text comes from "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The citation is enclosed within the <cite> tags and the author's last name and page number are included in parentheses after the quotation.

        It is worth noting that the <cite> tag does not automatically format the citation in a specific way; its primary function is to provide semantic meaning to the content. The actual formatting of the citation can be achieved through CSS styling or other means.
