        In HTML, the "disabled" attribute is used to indicate that an element should be disabled or non-interactive. When an element is disabled, it typically appears grayed out and cannot be clicked, selected, or modified by the user.

        The "disabled" attribute can be applied to various HTML elements, such as form controls (input, button, select, textarea) and interactive elements (a, area, fieldset, link).

    <!-- Disabling an input element: -->
    <input title="sample" type="text" disabled>


    <!-- Disabling a button element: -->
    <button type="button" disabled>Click me</button>


    <!-- Disabling a select element: -->
    <select title="sample" disabled>
        <option value="1">Option 1</option>
        <option value="2">Option 2</option>
    </select>


    <!-- Disabling a textarea element: -->
    <textarea title="sample" disabled>This is a disabled textarea.</textarea>


    <!--
        Note that the behavior and appearance of disabled elements can vary depending on the web browser and operating system being used. Additionally, disabled elements are typically excluded from form submissions, meaning their values are not sent when the form is submitted.
