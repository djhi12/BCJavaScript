    <!--
        The "embed" tag in HTML is used to embed multimedia content, such as videos, audio files, or interactive content, directly into a web page. The tag is typically used in conjunction with other multimedia-related tags, such as "video" or "audio", to specify the content that should be displayed.

        Here is an example of how to use the "embed" tag to embed a video on a web page:
    -->

    <embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" width="640" height="480">

    <!--
        In this example, the "src" attribute specifies the URL of the video to be embedded, while the "width" and "height" attributes specify the dimensions of the embedded content.

        Note that the "embed" tag is not supported in HTML5, and instead, you should use the "video" or "audio" tags, which provide better support for multimedia content.
