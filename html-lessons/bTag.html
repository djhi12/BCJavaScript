        The <b> tag is an HTML element used to represent text that should be rendered in a bold font weight. It is a formatting tag and has a deprecated status in HTML5, which means it is not recommended to use it for styling purposes. Instead, it's recommended to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the appearance of text.

        Here's an example of how to use the <b> tag in HTML:
    -->

    <p>This is a <b>bold</b> text.</p>

    <!--
        In the example above, the word "bold" will be displayed in a bold font weight. However, keep in mind that using the <b> tag for styling purposes is not considered best practice. Instead, you should use CSS to style your HTML elements. For example, you can achieve the same effect using CSS like this:
    -->

    <p>This is a <span class="bold-text">bold</span> text.</p>
    <!--
        In this example, the <span> element with the class "bold-text" is used along with CSS to achieve the bold styling. This approach separates the content from the presentation, which is considered a better practice in modern web development.
    -->
