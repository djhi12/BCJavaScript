        In HTML, the "title" attribute is used to provide additional information about an element. It is commonly used with various HTML elements, such as links, images, and form controls, to provide a tooltip or a brief description when the user hovers over or focuses on the element.

        The syntax for using the "title" attribute is as follows:
    -->

    <tagname title="text">Content</tagname>

    <!--
        Here, "tagname" represents the HTML element where you want to use the "title" attribute, and "text" represents the text or information that you want to display as a tooltip. The "Content" is the content of the HTML element itself.

        For example, let's say you have a link and you want to provide a tooltip for it. You can use the "title" attribute like this:
    -->

    <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit Example Website">Example</a>

    <!--
        In this case, when the user hovers over the link, a tooltip will appear with the text "Visit Example Website".

        It's important to note that the "title" attribute should be used sparingly and only for providing additional, non-essential information. It is not suitable for large amounts of text or critical information, as it may not be accessible to all users or be compatible with assistive technologies.
