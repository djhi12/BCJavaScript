    The "body" tag is an HTML element used to define the main content of a web page. It is one of the essential elements in HTML, and it is used to contain all the visible content of a web page, including text, images, videos, links, and more.

    The "body" tag is placed immediately after the opening "html" tag and before the closing "html" tag in an HTML document.
