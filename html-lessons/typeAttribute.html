        In HTML, the type attribute is used to specify the type of information that is expected to be entered in a form input field. The type attribute is used with various input elements, such as <input>, <button>, <select>, and <textarea>, to define the type of data that can be entered or selected by the user.

        For example, if you want the user to enter an email address in a form field, you would use the type="email" attribute on the <input> element. This would ensure that the browser validates the input and displays an error message if the user enters an invalid email address.

        Other common type values include text, password, number, checkbox, radio, file, and submit, among others. Each type value has specific behavior and validation rules associated with it.

        Here's an example of an <input> element with the type attribute set to "email":
    -->

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

    <!--
        In this example, the type attribute is set to "email", indicating that the user should enter a valid email address. The id and name attributes are also specified, which are used to identify the input field in the form and in JavaScript code.
    -->
