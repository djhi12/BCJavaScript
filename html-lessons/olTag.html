        The HTML "ol" tag is used to create ordered lists in a web page. "ol" stands for "ordered list." The ordered list is a list of items that are sequentially numbered or lettered by default. Each item in the list is marked with a list item tag, "li," which stands for "list item."

        Here's an example of how to use the "ol" tag in HTML:
    -->

    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
        In this example, we have an ordered list with three items. When the HTML is rendered in a web browser, it will appear as follows:

        First item
        Second item
        Third item
        By default, the numbering is displayed as Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3), but you can customize the appearance using CSS.

        You can also use different types of numbering for the list by specifying the "type" attribute on the "ol" tag. For example, you can use Roman numerals, uppercase letters, or lowercase letters. Here's an example:
    -->

    <ol type="I">
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
        In this case, the list will be displayed with Roman numerals:

        I. First item
        II. Second item
        III. Third item

        That's a basic overview of the "ol" tag in HTML. It provides a way to create ordered lists on your web pages.
