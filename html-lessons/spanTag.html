        In HTML, the <span> tag is an inline element used to group and style inline-level content. It does not create a new line or affect the flow of the content.

        The <span> tag is often used to apply styles to specific parts of text, such as changing the font color or size, or adding a background color. It can also be used to group inline elements together, allowing them to be targeted by CSS selectors.

        Here's an example of how to use the <span> tag to change the color of some text:
    -->

    <p>This is <span style="color: red;">some red text</span> in a paragraph.</p>

    <!--
        In this example, the <span> tag is used to wrap the text "some red text" and apply the style of red color to it.
    -->
</body>
