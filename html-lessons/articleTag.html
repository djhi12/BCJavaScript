        The <article> tag in HTML is used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused. It is often used for blog posts, news articles, forum posts, and other types of content that can stand alone.

        The content within an <article> tag should be complete in itself and not require additional context to be understood. It can include headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and other HTML elements.

        Here is an example of how the <article> tag can be used:
    -->

    <article>
        <h2>My Trip to Paris</h2>
        <img src="paris.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower">
        <p>Last summer, I took a trip to Paris and it was an amazing experience. I visited the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and ate delicious French cuisine. I highly recommend visiting Paris if you get the chance!</p>
    </article>

    <!-- In this example, the <article> tag contains a heading, an image, and a paragraph of text that together form a self-contained piece of content about a trip to Paris. -->
