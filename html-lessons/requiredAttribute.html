    <!--
        In HTML, the "required" attribute is used to indicate that a form field must be filled out before the form can be submitted. When this attribute is added to an input element such as a text input, checkbox, or radio button, the browser will prevent the form from being submitted if the field is left blank.

        Here's an example of how to use the "required" attribute in an HTML form:
    -->

    <form>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <!--
        In the example above, both the "name" and "email" fields have the "required" attribute set. This means that the user must fill out both fields before they can submit the form. If they try to submit the form without filling out either field, the browser will display an error message and prevent the form from being submitted.
    -->
