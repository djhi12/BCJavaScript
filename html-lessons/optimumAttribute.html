    <!--
        The "optimum" attribute is used in conjunction with the "meter" element in HTML. The "meter" element is used to display a measurement within a known range, such as progress bars or gauges.

        The "optimum" attribute specifies the optimal value for the measurement, which is typically the value at which the meter is considered "full" or "complete". This can help provide a visual indicator of progress towards a goal or target.

        Here's an example of how the "meter" element with the "optimum" attribute might be used:
    -->
    <progress value="80" max="100">80%</progress>
    <meter value="80" min="0" max="100" optimum="100">80%</meter>

    <!--
        In this example, the "progress" element displays a progress bar with the current value at 80 out of a maximum of 100. The "meter" element also displays the same value, but it also has an "optimum" attribute set to 100, indicating that the goal or target value is 100.

        I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
