    <!--
        The hgroup tag is an HTML element that is used to group multiple heading elements (h1 through h6) into a single heading. It was introduced in HTML5 but has since been deprecated and is no longer recommended for use.

        The syntax for the hgroup tag is as follows:
    -->

    <hgroup>
        <h1>Main Heading</h1>
        <h2>Subheading</h2>
    </hgroup>

    <!--
        In this example, the hgroup element contains two heading elements (h1 and h2) to create a hierarchical heading structure. The h1 element would be the main heading and the h2 element would be a subheading.

        However, it's important to note that the hgroup tag has been deprecated in favor of using multiple heading elements with appropriate levels of hierarchy. So instead of using the hgroup tag, you should simply use multiple h1, h2, etc. elements to create the desired heading structure.
