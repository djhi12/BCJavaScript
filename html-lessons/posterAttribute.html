        The "poster" attribute is used in HTML to specify an image or video thumbnail that represents the content of a <video> element. It allows you to display a static image or a poster frame before the video starts playing. When the video is not yet loaded or the user's browser does not support the <video> element, the specified poster image will be displayed instead.

        Here's an example of how the "poster" attribute is used:
    -->

    <video controls poster="path/to/poster-image.jpg">
        <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <!--
        In the example above, the "poster" attribute is added to the <video> element, and its value is set to the path of the poster image file ("path/to/poster-image.jpg"). When the page is loaded, the specified image will be displayed as the poster for the video.

        It's important to note that the "poster" attribute is optional. If you don't provide a poster image, some browsers may display a default play button or a blank area instead. Additionally, if the video is set to autoplay (autoplay attribute), the poster image will not be displayed as the video will start playing immediately.
