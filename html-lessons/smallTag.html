        In HTML, the <small> tag is used to define smaller text within a document. It is typically used to indicate a disclaimer, copyright information, or any text that is less important or of lesser significance than the surrounding content.

        Here's an example of how you can use the <small> tag in HTML:
    -->

    <p>This is a paragraph of normal-sized text. <small>This text is smaller.</small></p>

    <!--
        In the above example, the text within the <small> tags will be rendered with a smaller font size compared to the rest of the paragraph.

        It's important to note that the appearance of the <small> tag can vary depending on the CSS styles applied to it. By default, the browser may render it with a smaller font size, but you can modify its appearance using CSS properties such as font-size and font-weight.

        Here's an example of how you can style the <small> tag using CSS:
    -->

    <!--
        In this example, the <small> tag is styled to have a font size of 0.8em (80% of the parent element's font size) and a gray color. You can adjust the CSS properties according to your specific design requirements.
    -->
