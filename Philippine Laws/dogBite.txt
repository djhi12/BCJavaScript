Under Philippine law, the owner of a dog is liable for any damages caused by the animal. This includes any injuries or damages resulting from a dog bite.

If a person is bitten by a dog, they may file a complaint with the local police or barangay (community) officials. The owner of the dog may be required to provide compensation for any medical expenses incurred as a result of the bite.

In some cases, the dog may be impounded and subjected to a quarantine period to ensure that it does not have rabies. If the dog is found to have rabies, the owner may face additional penalties and the dog may be euthanized.

Under the Animal Welfare Act of 1998, animal cruelty is also punishable by law in the Philippines. This includes neglect or abuse of any animal, including dogs. Anyone who is found guilty of animal cruelty may face imprisonment and/or fines.
